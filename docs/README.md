# Barnham and Ford, West Sussex, UK

This is a representation of the small section of railway between Barnham and Ford, including the junctions to the East and West of the two stations. Services along this route are operated by Southern Railway with the occasional GWR service.

## Simulation

The simulation includes a simple weekday morning timetable, however, the emphasis of this route is to give developers a canvas for them to develop their own timetables which could also involve splits and joins reminisant of timetables in the early 2000s.

## Development

We welcome all developers to contribute to this route including, as mentioned above, timetables. You can submit any contributions on the Railway Operations Simulator GitHub organisation.

If you require any assistance in creation of a timetable or submitting it through GitHub, then visit the helpdesk channel on Discord and we'll be happy to help.
